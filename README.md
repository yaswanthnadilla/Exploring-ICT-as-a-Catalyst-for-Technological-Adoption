## Exploring-ICT-as-a-Catalyst-for-Technological-Adoption
This research delves into the multifaceted challenges of open defecation and the
constrained adoption of sanitation technology in rural Raichur villages, with a particular
focus on Mamanathodi, Karnataka, India. Against a global backdrop where 3.6 billion lack
improved sanitation, the study employs Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and Human-
Centered Design (HCD) methodologies, emphasizing the pivotal role of community-led initiatives
customized to local norms. Beyond presumptions that infrastructure alone eradicates
open defecation, the study illuminates socio-economic factors such as financial constraints,
water scarcity, and cultural beliefs contributing to its persistence in Mamanathodi. The interdisciplinary
teamâ€™s immersive ten-day experience, deploying PRA tools and observational
techniques, brings forth nuanced insights. The research integrates demographic data, field observations,
PRA tools, and scenario analyses. Proposing an ICT architecture for social change,
the study advocates for data-driven, stakeholder-engaged, and convergent approaches. The
envisioned architecture promises efficient data collection, stakeholder empowerment, information
convergence, and cost-effective, scalable interventions. In conclusion, the paper presents
recommendations urging policymakers to enhance stakeholder engagement and ensure the
sustained longevity of sanitation initiatives, contributing significantly to the discourse on
rural public health and hygiene practices.
